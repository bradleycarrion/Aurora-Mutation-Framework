# Mutation Framework
This is a project you can fork and use as a template for writing your mutation for Aurora. It takes care of most of the pesky details in the mutation creating process. Have fun coding :)
## How to use
### Fork the project
First, you will need to fork the project
### Change the package.json
In the `package.json`file you will need to change the `name`, `description`, and `author` parts of the file
### Code your mutation
The next and final thing you need to do is write the code for your mutation in the `index.js` file! Remember to still follow the steps in the [mutation writing tutorial](https://github.com/rainmaker022/Aurora-Mutation-Tutorial).
